/*
The way the Si5351 works (in a nutshell) is the a PLL frequency is generated based on the Crystal Frequency (XTAL).  A multisyncth multiplier (called Feedback Multisynth Divider
but I refer to is at the PLL multisynth multiplier) is used to generate the PLL frequency. The PLL frequency MUST be between 600 Mhz and 900 Mhz!!. So for 25 Mhz clock the multipler must 
be between 24 and 36

The output clock (clk0, clk1, clk2) take a PLL frequency and applied another multisyncth divider (called Output Multisynth Divider) to get the desired frequency.

So,
PLL Frequency = XTAL_Frequency * (PLL_MS_A + PLL_MS_B / PLL_MS_C), where A, B and C is the PLL Multisynch multiplier
Clock Output Frequency = Desired Frequency = PLL_Frequency / (MS_A + MS_B / MS_C), where A, B, C are a seperate other multisynth divider (Output Multisynth Divider)

Therefore its critical to get the B/C ratio to represent the fractional component of the divider/multiplier.  
For example, to generate a PLL frequency of 612500000 Hz (612.5 Mhz), we need to multiply the 25Mhz crystal frequency by 24.5 or (24 + 1/2) so B/C = 1/2

The FareyFraction () routine take a decimal number (e.g. 0.5) and generates approprite B & C values to represent the decimal number.

The A, B and C values are encoded and then written to various Si5351 registers.

A special note about drive current (2, 4, 6, or 8 mA).  To get 50R output impedence you must use 8 mA.  Using lower drives causes the output impedence to increase above 50R.

Si5351_def is structure that defines the following "multisynth" structure
=========================================================================
The multsynth structure is used to define parameters used to configure PLL and Multisynth dividers.  It does not 
represent a running state.  

multisynth.Fxtal is the reference crystal clock
multisynth.Fxtalcorr is the adjusted/corrected reference crystal clock based on correction/calibration value
multisynth.correction correction for xtal in parts per 10 million
multisynth.PLL is the PLL to use either 'A' or 'B'
multisynth.MS_Fout is the output frequency
multisynth.PLL_Fvco is the PLL Clock Frequency (Max 900 MHz)

multisynth.ClkEnable is a parameter used to enable or disable the clock being configured

multisynth.MSN_P1 is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MSN_P2 is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MSN_P3 is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider
multisynth.PLL_a is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider
multisynth.PLL_b is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider
multisynth.PLL_c is PLL Feedback Multisynth Divider

multisynth.PLL_Fvco = multisynth.Fxtal * (multisynth.PLL_a + multisynth.PLL_b/multisynth.PLL_c)
where a, b, c are fractional dividers for PLL frequency
a is multiplier, b is numerator and c is demonator (a+b/c)

multisynth.MS_a is Output Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MS_b is Output Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MS_c is Output Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MS_P1 is Output Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MS_P2 is Output Multisynth Divider
multisynth.MS_P3 is Output Multisynth Divider

multisynth.MS_Fout = multisynth.PLL_Fvco * (multisynth.MS_a + multisynth.MS_b/multisynth.MS_c)

To convert a, b and c to P1, P2 and P3 the following calculation is done for either PLL multisynch divider or output multisynch output
temp = (128*multisynth.MS_b)/multisynth.MS_c;      // Note that 128*multisynth.MS_b is done first to have the most accurate integer value
multisynth.MS_P1 = 128 * multisynth.MS_a + temp - 512;
multisynth.MS_P2 = 128 * multisynth.MS_b - multisynth.MS_c * temp;
multisynth.MS_P3 = multisynth.MS_c;
where a, b, c are fractional dividers for output
a is multiplier, b is numerator and c is demonator (a+b/c)

multisynth.R_DIV R_DIV MUST be used for frequencies below 500 Hz (to min of 8 Khz).  These routines used R_DIV for frequencies below 1 Mhz.  R_DIV indicates that the output frequency should be divided by 1, 2, 4, 8,....128. 
R_DIV = 0 means divide by 1 (the default configuration).  Bascially the output frequecy is multiplied by an interger to get the frequency above
1 Mhz, then the R_DIV is applied to bring the frequency back to the frequency.
For example, for 800 Khz:
- The frequency output is multiplied by 4 (4x800=3.2 Mhz). That is the PLL and Output Multisynth for Clock is set to 3.2 Mhz
- The R_DIV is set to 4 so the actual output frequency is 3.2/4 = 800 Khz
- This may see silly but its necessary for the Si5351 below 500 Khz.  This was done below 1 Mhz for convenience.

multisynth.MS_DIVBY4 is a similar divider that is used for frequencies above 150 Mhz to 160 Mhz.  The Multisynth cannot generate frequencies easily above 150 Mhz (its too small). 
So you need to setup the PLL and output multisynch for 4xDesiged frequency.  PLL frequencies must be between 600 to 900 Mhz.  4x150 Mhz is 600 Mhz.  So, we setup the PLL and Multisynch 
to generate 4x the desired fequency and then apply the divide by 4 (MS_DIVBY4) at the end to bring the frequency back to the desired frequency.

multisynth.ClkEnable is a parameter that is used to enable and disable the clock.

Si5351_CLK_def is structure that defines clock control (clk0ctl, clk1ctl, clk2ctl) structure as follows
=======================================================================================================
The clock control structure is used to define parameters for the current running state of the clock.
clk0ctl, clk1ctl and clk2ctl structure are all the same except they are dedicated to the specific clock. 
At any point in time, these structures defines how the clock is configured.

clk0ctl.PLL is the PLL that is assigned to the clock. Either "A" or "B"
clk0ctl.mAdrive is the actual mA for the output i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8.  The UpdateDrive() routine converts to appropriate register value
clk0ctl.phase is the phase from 0 to clk0ctl.maxangle. Each binary value increments the delay for the output frequency by 1 / (4 x clk0ctl.PLLFreq)
clk0ctl.maxangle is the maximum phase based on the PLL Frequency used to generate the output frequency
clk0ctl.reg is the control register (16,17,18) value that was last written to the Si5351
clk0ctl.freq is the output frequency for the running clock
clk0ctl.PLLFreq is the PLL Frequency that is used to generate the output frequency
